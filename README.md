# Term-Project-TMU-Programming

**Details**

This term project requires the extraction and computation of temperature records from 1750 to 2015, utilizing C programming for data manipulation and GNUPlot for generating graphical representations. Students were given data in the form of a .csv file, and had to extract each column into seperate arrays. 

**Questions to Solve**
1. Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the yearly averages for each year between 1760 and 2015 (the average of the twelve months of each year). One average per year. Ignore the years 1750-1759. 

2. Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the average land temperature for the different centuries: 18th century (1760-1799), 19th century (1800-1899), 20th century (1900-1999) and 21st century (2000-2015). One average per century. 

3. Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the monthly averages for each month for all years combined between 1900 and 2015. A total of twelve averages. One average per month. 

4. Based on the land average temperature column, what was the hottest month recorded and what was the coldest month recorded (month and year in each case). In case of a tie, mention only one (doesn't matter which one). 

5. Based on your answer in question 1, what year was the hottest and what year was the coldest? 

6. Based on your answer in question 1, generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to make a graph (line plot) of the yearly temperatures for the years 1760 to 2015. Label the axes clearly and add a title and legend to your graph. 

7. Generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to make a graph (line plots) of the average land temperatures for the 19th and 20th centuries. Put both lines on the same figure. Ensure that you have the same x-axis scale (for example 1852 and 1952 would both have an x-value of 52). Have your two line plots with different colours. Label the axes clearly and add a title and legend to your graph. 

8. Using the columns LandAverageTemperature, LandMaxTemperature and LandMinTemperature, generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to make line plots that show all three temperatures on the same figure. Use the years for the x-axis (use only the years between 1850 and 2015) and the yearly averages for the y-axis. Use three different colours (or different line styles) for the three lines. Make sure that the line plotting LandAverageTemperature stands out from the other two (ex: make that line thicker). Make sure your graph has a title, axes labels and a legend that explicitly tells which line is which. 

9. Using the columns LandAverageTemperature, LandMaxTemperature and LandMinTemperature, generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to make 3 bar plots (box or histogram plots) that show the average, low and high temperatures for each of the 19th (after 1850), 20th and 21st centuries. Put all 3 plots on the same figure displayed as subplots (multiplots). Each plot will show the boxes with different colours (one colour per century). Have a title to your figure and have the low or average or high as the title on each subplot. 

10. For the years 2000 to 2015, generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to make an error bar plot of the average land temperature by month. Use the uncertainty column for land temperatures to draw the error bars. 

11. Generate a GNUPlot data file and use GNUPlot to do a plot similar to what you did in question 6 (LandAverageTemperature) but only for the years 1850 to 2015 and add the data for the LandAndOceanAverageTemperatures column. Have the two lines on the same figure. Label the axes clearly and add a title and legend to your graph.
